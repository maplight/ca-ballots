# California Quick Guide to Propositions
The Quick Guide to Propositions is one of the easiest ways for Californians to get key information about statewide ballot measures.  It provides an overview of each measure that's easy to understand - as well as important information about who is funding campaigns for and against the measures.

Built in partnership between [MapLight](http://maplight.org/) and the Secretary of State, the Quick Guide to Propositions launched on October 13, 2016 at [https://quickguidetoprops.sos.ca.gov](https://quickguidetoprops.sos.ca.gov). 

Development of the Quick Guide to Props was generously funded with a grant from The James Irvine Foundation with the goal of improving political transparency in California.
